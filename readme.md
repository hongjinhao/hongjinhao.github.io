This repo contains all the files for the github.io site which hosts my resume. 

The idea is to use a NFC card and direct people to this website as a fun demonstration of JS, HTML and CSS. 

This website is deployed through GitHub Pages. To view the live version, visit [hongjinhao.github.io](https://hongjinhao.github.io).
