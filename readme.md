# Personal Portfolio Website

This repo contains the front end for the github.io site which hosts my resume.  
This website is deployed through GitHub Pages. To view the website, visit [hongjinhao.github.io](https://hongjinhao.github.io).

The project started off with a fun idea to use a NFC card and direct people to my website that contained my resume as a fun demonstration of my skills and experiences.
Later, the project became a deeper dive into full-stack development, where I learnt JS, express, node.js, MySQL and deploying a web app. 

The backend if deployed, will make the like button interactive and store the counts.   
The backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/hongjinhao/hongjinhao.github.io_backend/)
